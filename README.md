📘 Natural Language Processing (NLP) – Learning Notes

Welcome to my Natural Language Processing (NLP) learning repository!
This space contains my notes, explanations, experiments, and summaries of important NLP concepts that I am studying.

🧠 What is NLP?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
It combines:

Linguistics
Machine Learning
Deep Learning
