📘 Natural Language Processing (NLP) – Learning Notes

Welcome to my Natural Language Processing (NLP) learning repository!
This space contains my notes, explanations, experiments, and summaries of important NLP concepts that I am studying.

🧠 What is NLP?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
It combines:

Linguistics
Machine Learning
Deep Learning

📚 Topics I Am Learning

✔️ 1. Text Preprocessing
  Tokenization
  Stopword Removal
  Stemming vs Lemmatization
  Lowercasing
  Removing punctuation
  Normalization

✔️ 2. Text Representation
  Bag of Words (BoW)
  One-hot encoding
  TF-IDF
  Word Embeddings
  Word2Vec
  CBOW
  Skip-Gram
  GloVe
  Sentence Embeddings

✔️ 3. Word2Vec Concepts
  Context window
  CBOW (predict target using context)
  Skip-Gram (predict context using target)
  Negative Sampling
  Normalized vectors
  Cosine similarity

✔️ 4. Dimensionality Reduction
  PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
  t-SNE (visualization)

✔️ 5. Text Classification Basics
  Naive Bayes
  Logistic Regression
  SVM
  Training / testing splits
  Evaluation metrics

✔️ 6. Advanced NLP (Future Learning)
  RNNs / LSTMs / GRUs
  Transformers
  Attention mechanism
  BERT, GPT
  Machine Translation


🧪 Hands-on Practice
  I am practicing the learned concepts using small experiments like:
  Tokenizing a dataset
  Building BoW and TF-IDF vectors
  Training a Word2Vec embedding model
  Visualizing word embeddings with PCA
  Simple sentiment analysis models


🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
  Python
  NLTK
  SpaCy
  Gensim
  Scikit-learn
  NumPy / Pandas
  Matplotlib / Seaborn
